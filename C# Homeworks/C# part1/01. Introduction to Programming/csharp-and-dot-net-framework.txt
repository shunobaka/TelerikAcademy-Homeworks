.NET Framework is a software framework developed by Microsoft that runs
primarily on Microsoft Windows. It includes a large class library known
as Framework Class Library (FCL) and provides language interoperability
(each language can use code written in other languages) across several
programming languages. C# is just one of the programming languages,
supported by the .NET framework. It was developed by Microsoft within
its .NET initiative and is one of the programming languages designed
for the Common Language Infrastructure.
