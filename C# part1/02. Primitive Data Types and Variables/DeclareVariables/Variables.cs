//Problem 1. Declare Variables

//Declare five variables choosing for each of them the most appropriate of the types byte, sbyte, short, ushort, int, uint, long, ulong to represent the following values: 52130, -115, 4825932, 97, -10000.
//Choose a large enough type for each number to ensure it will fit in it. Try to compile the code.

using System;

class Variables
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int number1 = 52130;
        sbyte number2 = -115;
        int number3 = 4825932;
        byte number4 = 97;
        short number5 = -10000;
    }
