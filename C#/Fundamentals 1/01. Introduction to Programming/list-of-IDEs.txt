1. Microsoft Visual Studio

Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment
(IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop computer programs for
Microsoft Windows, as well as web sites, web applications and web
services. Visual Studio uses Microsoft software development platforms
such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation,
Windows Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native
code and managed code.

2. Eclipse

Eclipse is an integrated development environment (IDE). It contains
a base workspace and an extensible plug-in system for customizing the
environment. Written mostly in Java, Eclipse can be used to develop
applications. By means of various plug-ins, Eclipse may also be used
to develop applications in other programming languages: Ada, ABAP, C,
C++, COBOL, Fortran, Haskell, JavaScript, Lasso, Natural, Perl, PHP,
Prolog, Python, R, Ruby (including Ruby on Rails framework), Scala,
Clojure, Groovy, Scheme, and Erlang. It can also be used to develop
packages for the software Mathematica. Development environments include
the Eclipse Java development tools (JDT) for Java and Scala, Eclipse CDT
for C/C++ and Eclipse PDT for PHP, among others.

3. NetBeans

NetBeans is an integrated development environment (IDE) for developing
primarily with Java, but also with other languages, in particular PHP,
C/C++, and HTML5. It is also an application platform framework for Java
desktop applications and others. The NetBeans IDE is written in Java and
can run on Windows, OS X, Linux, Solaris and other platforms supporting
a compatible JVM. The NetBeans Platform allows applications to be developed
from a set of modular software components called modules. Applications based
on the NetBeans Platform (including the NetBeans IDE itself) can be extended
by third party developers.

4. MonoDevelop

onoDevelop is an open source integrated development environment for Linux,
OS X, and Windows. Its primary focus is development of projects that use
Mono and .NET frameworks. MonoDevelop integrates features similar to those
of NetBeans and Microsoft Visual Studio, such as automatic code completion,
source control, a graphical user interface (GUI) and Web designer. MonoDevelop
integrates a Gtk# GUI designer called Stetic. It supports Boo, C, C++, C#, CIL,
D, F#, Java, Oxygene, Python, Vala, and Visual Basic.NET.
